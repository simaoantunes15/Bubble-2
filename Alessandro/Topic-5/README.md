# Java Topic 5 - Array, ArrayList and Strings

Exercise 5.1.  Try to do the exercise of Java Course: Chapter 7a, but instead to generate tickets, try to generate random strings of 5 length. When you will print the strings, change it to UpperCase.

Exercise 5.2. Write a program that read a sentence(at least 4 words), split the string by spaces and store each piece of strings in an Array. Later print the third element, change the second element to 0, print all the elements and sort it.

Exercise 5.3. Write a program that initialize 5 strings in an ArrayList. Add another element, remove the first, print the size of the arraylist, print the element in the index 3, and use Iterator class to print all the elements of the arraylist. Finally, check all the elements of the arraylist and find the elements that contains the letter “e”.

Exercise 5.4. Declare two equals strings, one in uppercase and another one in lower case. Try to use equalsIgnoreCase()  and equals() to know if both strings are the same or not.

Now declare the following variables:

String string1= “ELI”;

String string2= new String(“ELI”);

Can you try to compare with "=="?. It works in the same way that equals()? Why? Bring your answers to the daily :)

Exercise 5.5. Write a program that initialize 5 strings in an ArrayList. From String class, use replace method to replace the "e" letter for "x" letter. Now include some spaces before each of the elements of the arrrayList with concat(), print it and use the method trim() to remove the spaces.
