# Java Topic 4 - For and Methods

Exercise 4.1. Try to do the exercise of Java Course: Chapter 4d, but instead of read the number of students and test, it should read the number of cars in a traffic jam, and thinking that each car has 2 people, fill the age of the people. Finally print the average of people.

Exercise 4.2.  Try to do the exercise of Java Course: chapter 5a but add another two methods. The first one should print the edge of the person, and the second one if she is or not a zombie.

Exercise 4.3. Write a program to read an integer value on the keyboard and print an asterisk square of this size. For instance, if the number is 4, the program must print: **** **** **** ****

Exercise 4.4. You have to design the code of the access of an account. The user can try the access 3 times, if the pin is not correct 3 times, the account will be blocked.

The pin must be a number of 4 digits.

The actions of the system should be:

- Verify if it’s only a numbers (no letters)

- Verify if its only 4 digits (not 3 or 1, it must be 4)

- If the pin code doesn’t fit, user must fill again and again (infinite times) until the pin code accomplish the rules.

- If the pin code is correct, system allows access to the account.

- If the pin code is incorrect, user has other 2 tries. If after the 3 attempts user don’t fill the correct pin code, the account will be blocked.

Note: take it easy. Try to develop the code following these steps:

Step 1: First try to create the code to fill the pin code.  Use "String pincode = scanner.next();”.

Step 2:Then try to include the limit of 3 tries.

Step 3: When it works try to include the rule of the 4 elements

Step 4: At the end include the rule that it couldn’t be different of a number.

Be patient, this is a difficult exercise.
